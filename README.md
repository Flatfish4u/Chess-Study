Most recent trial that I edited was the "Attempt to run it with move quality." This was where I attempted to factor in "position quality," and see if there was 
any difference between players in certain positions

the only issue I found is that it seems that it's reading game files incorrectly, and sonmehow reading "illegal moves" as part of games, which it obviously should not be doing 

I was wondering if we could categorize moves and lines by creativity or traps. I read a paper on stockfish identifying creativity but that was a load of bs as it tries to match human-identified brilliant moves with top engine line. Maybe we could work out a criteria for identification? 

PGN is not native for stockfish. It prefers pure algebraic notation. I could come up with an easy translation program for that but I'll probably go over the code once more sometime tomorrow or next week.

Most recent trial that I edited was the "Attempt to run it with move quality." This was where I attempted to factor in "position quality," and see if there was 
any difference between players in certain positions

the only issue I found is that it seems that it's reading game files incorrectly, and sonmehow reading "illegal moves" as part of games, which it obviously should not be doing
